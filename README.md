### Export Formats

#### JSON

#### Markdown
- Human-readable format with formatting
- Shows only the current chat branch
- Includes optional metadata (timestamps, model info)
- Great for documentation or sharing

- Simple format following Claude's prompt style
- Uses "User:" and "Claude:" prefixes

### Known Limitations

- Plaintext and markdown formats only export the currently selected branch in chats with multiple branches
- Large bulk exports may take several minutes
- Rate limiting: The extension processes chats in small batches to avoid overwhelming the API

### Roadmap

- Export as .pdf
- Sync to Google Drive or local filesystem
- Include time with date
- Flag new or updated chats since last export

### Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens in your browser
- **No External Servers**: The extension doesn't send data anywhere
- **Your Authentication**: Uses your existing DeepSeek session
